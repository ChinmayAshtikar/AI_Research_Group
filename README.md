*AI Research Group*  

The Northeastern AI Research Group (known as NEU AI Skunkworks) is a student group focused on teaching innovative, creative, and critical thinking skills. The work focuses on three core domains: publishing papers and Medium style articles related to AI, Kaggle competitions and data sets, and entrepreneurship.

Learning comes not just from understanding facts but from understanding how to apply those facts. The first step in the technology and education has already occurred. The learning of factual knowledge and technical skills. Online educational sites like EdX, Coursera, Udemy and many others how shown that technical knowledge can be taught very well online. The combination of excellent content, great teachers and the prevalence of content has democratized learning.

Teaching creative, and critical thinking still lags the success of teaching technical knowledge. In the STEM fields which are the catalyst of the artificial intelligence revolution there are no respected part-time PhD programs. The apprenticeship learning model, the process of learning by mentorship from an expert has been shown to be effective in fields ranging from engineering to art. This model has produced some exceptional thinkers and nearly every PhD ever granted a STEM degree.

AI Skunkworks offers four kinds of mentorship:

1) Publishing articles related to AI    
2) Contributing the open-source projects    
3) Kaggle competitions    
4) Entrepreneurship
