# Artificial Intelligence - Entrepreneurship Group

Artificial Intelligence - Entrepreneurship Group

The idea is to connect people with various skills (fundraising, management, web dev, DevOps, data science, etc.) to build a minimum viable product that can be used to raise money for a company.

In addition, we will have some workshops on forming a business, running a business, fundraising, real-time 3D and games, machine learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, web development MLOPs, and causal inference.


##  Entrepreneurship   

Students and alumni meet with students from the D'Amore-McKim School of Business at Northeastern University and create viable prototypes to raise money for a business.
